              <b>Introduction</b>
              <p>A regional assessment of logs, cores and tests from approximately 1,400 wells in southwestern Alberta and
                northwestern Montana, augmented by outcrop study in north-central Montana and aeromagnetic, gravity and seismic data,
                was undertaken in order to document the controls on pooling within Mississippian units and to recommend new areas for
                exploration. The subsurface component of the evaluation covers Townships 36 and 37, Ranges 5W - 11W in Montana and
                Townships 1-20, Ranges 20 - 30 W4M in Alberta.</p>
              <p>The structural architecture of the region contains two major Precambrian blocks; the Matzihwin High and the Medicine
                Hat Block, which are separated by the southwest-northeast trending Vulcan Low. South of the Vulcan Low, structure
                takes the form of several northwest-striking.</p>
              <p>Features which, when analyzed in detail, appear as northwest-plunging antiforms which are commonly fault-bounded.
                Additional economically significant, but subtle structural features are small rollovers found on the up-plunge
                (i.e., to the southeast) side of the antiforms.</p>
              <p>The Mississippian package is formed of a lower muddy, locally shaley, marine shelf package (i.e., Banff, Lodgepole).
                Small isolated bioherms are found at the base, and are overlain by several stacked parasequence sets of alternating
                burrowed mudstones and rippled to cross-bedded packstones and grainstones.</p>
              <p>The upper Mississippian package (Livingstone, Rundle, Mission Canyon, Sun River) contains complexly interbedded
                mudstones, wackestones, and packstones with rare grainstones. These deposits formed in subtidal to peritidal
                environments. Consistent regional correlations are not discernable within these rocks, which are further complicated
                by the presence of brecciated, muddy, solution collapse zones. The strata are organized into both small- and
                large-scale clinoforms with northerly and southerly dips. This stratigraphic architecture precludes a 'layer cake'
                assessment of stratigraphy and complicates the application of entrenched stratigraphic terminology.</p>
              <p>South of the Vulcan Low, the upper portion of the Mississippian section is dolomitized, which results in a blanket
                of porous and permeable rock. North of the Vulcan Low, both limestone and dolomite are encountered, but porous and
                permeable rocks are still present within virtually every well.</p>
              <p>Other major alteration productions include silicification of burrow fills in the Lodgepole-Banff, and bitumen
                linings of many pores. Bitumen and pyrobitumen are so abundant at some locales that they constitute a major destroyer
                of reservoir quality (e.g. Del Bonita). Fracturing, both tectonic and that related to polyphase karsting, has also
                affected reservoir development by adding a component of heterogeneous vertical permeability to the succession.</p>
              <p>The systematics of fluids within the Mississippian sequence take the following forms:
                <ol>
                  <li>Oil gravity and gas content increase to the west and south;</li>
                  <li>Downdip water flow occurs from uplifted areas in the south, localized foothills recharge sites, and from eastern
                    topographic highs;</li>
                  <li>A trend of wells with bypassed pay within the Mississippian is located due east of the Lower Cretaceous 'Deep
                    Basin'.</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>The Banff/Lodgepole is characterized by isolated reservoirs and aquifers, whereas the Rundle/Livingstone/Mission
                Canyon displays widespread vertical and lateral reservoirs and aquifers. A total of 54 wells display bypassed or
                damaged petroliferous zones within the Mississippian.</p>
              <p>To date few wells have been completed within the Banff/Lodgepole due to limited reservoir development and modest oil
                recoveries. In contrast, the widespread blanket development of porous and permeable rock within the
                Rundle/Livingstone/Mission Canyon causes structure to have a significant influence on pooling, with pool reserves up
                to 1-10 MMBO encountered in the study area. Complicating the role of structure are stratigraphic complications such as
                lenses of bioclastic units, fractures, bitumen-plugging, karst development, Rierdon shale thickness, and Mesozoic
                valley fills.</p>
              <p>The best pools are located where secondary migration of oil, via hydrodynamic flow, has focused petroleum
                accumulations into the vicinity of structural highs (e.g., Reagan, Del Bonita-Landslide Butte, Claresholm).</p>
              <p>South of the Vulcan Low the vertical seals to Mississippian pools are Jurassic shales. Where the shales are less than
                25 metres thick, hydrocarbons have breached the seal and charged Lower Cretaceous reservoirs (e.g., Cut Bank, Long
                Coulee, Carmangay). In some cases heavier oils (25-28o API) are still produced from the Mississippian where Jurassic
                shale thicknesses range from 0-25 metres (e.g. Blackfoot, Red Creek). Where Jurassic shales exceed 25 metres, light
                oils (37-40o API) are encountered within Mississippian reservoirs (e.g. Reagan, Del Bonita, Claresholm).</p>
              <p>North of the Vulcan Low, light oil and gas are found within Mississippian units which lack any Jurassic shales as a
                vertical seal (e.g., Gladys, Herronton). However, these pools possess intra-Mississippian permeability barriers such
                as tight brecciated units, which trap hydrocarbons significantly below the top of the Mississippian.</p>
              <p>Several play types have been identified for the Mississippian succession in the study area. A conceptual play type
                can be found within the bioherms (Waulsortian mounds) of the Lodgepole/Banif. These features are anticipated to occur
                at the base of major clinoforms near major basement structures. In these deposits the flank facies, formed of crinoidal
                grainstone, are the prospective reservoirs, whereas the central mound units, though forming paleotopographic highs, are
                formed of tight, fractured mudstones. The dominant play type is formed in the porous and permeable blankets of
                Rundle/Livingstone/Mission Canyon units where they intersect northwest-plunging antiforms. Up-plunge rollovers
                (i.e. to the southeast) on these structures are necessary for entrapment. Where a regional Mississippian hydraulic low
                coincides with these structures and Jurassic shale thicknesses are greater than 25 metres, the best potential trends
                occur. Multiple pools should be found along the strike of these trends (e.g. Landslide Butte - Del Bonita - Spring
                Coulee trend). In the vicinity of the Mississippian hydraulic low, 54 bypassed and/or damaged Mississippian zones
                have been identified. Furthermore, many wells have tested Cretaceous targets on prominent structures where the Rierdon
                is over 25 metres thick, but have terminated drilling in the Mesozoic. These locations may represent potential
                Mississippian leads.</p>
